$def with (user)
<h1>All Users</h1>
<p>Users that don't have a profile picture haven't uploaded one. I'll add in a default one as soon as I find one we can use without copyright issues.</p>
$for user in user:
    <hr/>
    $if user.pic:
        <img src='$(user.pic)' style='width: 50px; height: 50px'/>
        <br/>
    <a href='/$user.username'><b>$user.name</b></a>
