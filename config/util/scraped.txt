DOSH wallets aim to help you get rid of any excess baggage and streamline the contents you carry with you, which may count as a small but great change in your daily routine.\nToday we\u2019ll be looking at one of DOSH\u2019s newest wallets, the Syncro iPhone 5/5S wallet, which was provided to me by DOSH for this review.\n\nI\u2019ve been using the Syncro wallet with iPhone 5S for about a week now and got a good use of it so far. The wallet is basically a TPU iPhone sleeve with outer pockets on both sides for carrying your credit cards and cash. The TPU material of the wallet is quite solid, it feels soft, it\u2019s water resistant and it should be very durable and can withhold any use and abuse.\nThe main compartment holds your phone securely in place. It is snug enough that your phone won\u2019t move or accidentally slip out. I\u2019ve shook it quite hard, held it upside down, shook it again and the iPhone remained in place. Yet, when you pull your phone out, it will come out easily. I\u2019m not sure what is happening inside the Syncro that keeps everything tight in place, but it works perfectly.\n\nThe external pockets are quite useful, too. It can hold up to 6 cards total, 3 per pocket. It can also hold some cash notes and they\u2019ll fit securely in place. I\u2019ve first tested the pocket with a card then I added another one. Having less than 3 cards in a pocket, the cards will feel loose inside. At first, I thought this could be an issue. However, even though the two cards were loose inside the pocket, they did not fall off when I held the wallet upside down or when I shook it. Because there\u2019s a bit of a hollowness to the pockets, your cards will remain inside and will not slip.\nOverall, I\u2019m very pleased with the DOSH Syncro wallet for iPhone 5/5S. I\u2019m quite surprised with how simple the design is and how perfectly it works. It is lightweight and most probably much lighter than your current wallet. The material is of great quality that you don\u2019t have to worry about it wearing out any time soon. It is made in locally in Australia of 100% recyclable material.\xa0 Like most iPhone wallets, you won\u2019t be able to fit in an iPhone with a case on it. This could be a deal breaker for some people, it\u2019s not an issue for me personally though.\nThe DOSH Syncro Wallet is available in 8 colors. You can buy it for $69.95 with free worldwide delivery at doshbrand.com. \nBuy it here\n', 'title': u'DOSH Syncro iPhone 5/5S Wallet [Review]'}, {'image': u'http://www.holycool.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/MapMyState-Prints.jpeg', 'link': u'http://www.mapmystate.com/', 'description': u'\n\nWhichever part of the world you call home, we know you take pride in it.

Published by Titan Books, who provided me with this copy for a review, Crazy 4 Cult 2 is a collection of cult film themed artwork from LA\u2019s famous art gallery Gallery 1988. The book starts with an intro by Seth Rogen, after that, get ready to get lost in a world of beautiful artwork inspired by films like The Shining, Ghost Busters, Shaun of the Dead, The Big Lebowski, Edward Scissorhands, and many many more across 170 pages of the book\u2026\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that this book is NOT about movie posters, but rather, original artwork that reflects an iconic character or a scene from a movie. That\u2019s what makes it such an enjoyable book to browse, seeing some of your favorite cult films interpreted in a new way. And since probably many of us cannot afford to collect this huge collection of original artwork, it\u2019s great to have these prints compiled in a single book.\n\nCrazy 4 Cult 2 makes a wonderful coffee table book that is a MUST-HAVE for any film geek. It is thoroughly entertaining, the artwork is beautiful and will not disappoint. The book is available in two volumes. \nBuy it here\n', 'title': u'Crazy 4 Cult: Cult Movie Art Book [Review]'}, {'image': u'http://www.holycool.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/The-HOST-Chill-Cooling-Pour-Spout.jpg', 'link': u'http://www.thefowndry.com/collections/drinking-gifts/products/host-chill-cooling-pour-spout', 'description': u'\nWe like to think that every season is drinking season, but the Holidays are extra special when it comes to drinking and they are just around the corner.

I have found the most practical, durable and modern magic wallet you can get, which I\u2019ll be reviewing here courtesy of our friends at DOSH.\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with the concept of a magic wallet, watch the following video of a Dosh Magic Wallet that we\u2019re borrowing from YouTube:\n\n\nThe DOSH Magic Wallet is quite fun, and unlike many other fun products in the world, that does not compromise the quality of it. It is compact in size (105 x 74 x 12mm), very light and is made of superior TPU material that feels nice in hand and is quite durable. The outside features 4 slots that hold 1 card each. On the inside, the straps are of TPU material as well, they\u2019ll hold your cash and receipts securely in place.\n\nI\u2019ve been using this magic wallet by DOSH for around a week or so, and this is how I feel about it so far:\nWhat I like:\n\nThe cool factor! My friends have been quite impressed and they\u2019re still trying to figure out how it really works.\nIt\u2019s made of solid material. This wallet won\u2019t tear or break anytime soon. It\u2019s also waterproof.\nIt\u2019s very minimal, small in size, and easy to carry in a pocket without crowding it.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t like:\n\nThe card slots, although they hold the cards securely, I don\u2019t like that in the second slot the card sticks almost half way out.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m quite pleased with the Magic Wallet by DOSH. I knew I was becoming a fan of DOSH products since I reviewed their Syncro iPhone Wallet Reviewing a second product by them confirms their dedication to superior quality, functionality and innovation.\nThe DOSH Magic Wallet is available in 7 color combinations.

Vinyl labels for iDevice chargers which allows you to personalize and give each charger you have a character. No one will steal your charger and pretend it\u2019s theirs anymore! The project on Kickstarter initially needed $6000 to get off the ground, but raised $20,000 instead!\nSativa Turner, creator of Whooz? Labels was kind enough to send me a set of stickers for a review.\n\n\nI got the iPhone Character set, which includes 4 characters for iPhone chargers. Each sheet includes labels for the charger, the USB cable as well as the earphones.\nThe package features clear instructions on how to apply the labels and which part goes where (tips are written inside the package), it shouldn\u2019t take you more than a few minutes to apply them and transform your charger into a character.\n\nThe labels are of great quality, they\u2019re made of vinyl so they should be durable and won\u2019t peel off or wipe out easily. The product is very cute as much as it is functional. I believe this is a must-have for any family or individual that owns many iDevices. We\u2019ve all been in situations where someone \u201cborrows\u201d our charger then suddenly that charger becomes theirs somehow. Or your charger gets mixed up with an old and worn out one and you wonder why it\u2019s not working properly anymore. Well, all those issues are no-more with Whooz ID labels. And even if you don\u2019t need to ID your charger, those stickers are just cool to have.\nThe Whooz? labels are available for iPhone and iPad chargers in a character set or color set.

The nice guys at Truffol were also kind enough to send me a couple of skins to try out for this review.\nWhat Is the Truffol Autograph Leather Skin?\nIt\u2019s a genuine leather skin with an adhesive back that you can easily apply on the back of your phone. It\u2019s simple yet very beautiful, it instantly classes up your phone. The skin is precisely cut to fit your phone perfectly, and it\u2019s only 0.6mm in thickness, so it doesn\u2019t add any weight or thickness to your phone.\n\nWhat you get in the packages is:\n\nThe leather skin.\na complimentary screen protector, microfiber cloth and dust removal tool.\n\nHow To Apply the Skin:\nIt\u2019s a pretty straight forward task. Simply peel the plastic off the adhesive back and gently apply the skin on your phone. The adhesive is good for a number of uses, not quite sure how many, but I did take it off and on again at least 5 to 6 times and it\u2019s still holding on very well. I would advice that you keep the protective plastic in case you ever want to take the skin off and use it again at a later time. I was pleased to find out that my iPhone 5S fit nicely into the case I had even with the skin on (I use a Spigen Slim Armor Case) so you might not even need to take the skin off.\n\nQuality and Feel of the Autograph Leather Skin:\nThe quality is certainly of high standard. The nice smell of leather will hit you as soon as you open that package. It also has a grained texture to it that feels nice in hand. The bottom of the skin holds the logo of Truffol either in stainless steel or rose gold, depending on the color of the leather.\nTruffol offers a free personalization service for the Autograph leather skin. You can have up to three letters embossed on it to make it more your own.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the Truffol Autograph leather skin is not meant to be protective. Of course, it will protect the back of your phone from scratches, but this isn\u2019t something you buy for overall protection against drops for example. That said, your phone will definitely look much better than having a case on it. I\u2019ve already gotten so many positive comments on mine.\nAs I already have a screen protector on my phone, I did not apply the complimentary protector I received with the skin, so I won\u2019t be commenting on that.\n\nThe Autograph Leather Skin is available in four colors, and in two variants: Standard or Card, which has a pocket good for holding a credit card or a driver\u2019s license. You can get it for your iPhone 5/5S or Samsung Galaxy S4 for only $18 or $22 for the Card version.\nYou can learn more about the Autograph Leather Skin here: http://truffol.com/autograph\nBuy it here\n', 'title': u'Truffol Autograph Leather Skin for iPhone 5/5S Or Galaxy S4 [Review]'}, {'image': u'http://www.holycool.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Oversized-Safety-Pin-2.jpeg', 'link': u'http://www.coxandcox.co.uk/just-arrived/two-safety-pins', 'description': u'\n\nA set of two over-sized safety pins.

One of the creators of Tarxia, Adri\xe1n Rosales Mill\xe1n, was kind enough to offer me one for a\xa0 hands-on review.\nDesign & Materials:\nThe Tarxia collection features 4 designs that feature distinctive geometric designs associated with Arabian Andalusi art. You\u2019ll notice how different these designs are from all available iPhone cover designs at first sight. They truly stand out.\n\n\nDifferent types of wood are used as the main material for these covers. Geometric mosaics are cut and assembled, piece by piece, by local craftsmen in Granada who specialize in the Taracea technique. The result is a beautiful piece of art to go with your iPhone.\nAlthough Tarxia is made of wood, it feels very smooth, almost like a ceramic tile. The varnishing used gives it a smooth matt finish, it protects it from scratches and water and makes it safe for daily use.\nInstallation:\nNow it\u2019s important to understand that this is not your usual case or a cover, it is actually a back panel that replaces your iPhone\u2019s glass battery cover. The idea of Tarxia is that it gives your iPhone an artistic look and necessary protection without adding any volume to it or taking away from its design and shape. So installing a Tarxia back cover requires some work, but it\u2019s quite simple\u2026 it took me less than 2 minutes to install.\n \nSimply, you\u2019ll have to unscrew your iPhone\u2019s back panel using the provided screwdriver. The back panel slides up and can be easily removed. Then, you\u2019ll replace it with the Tarxia back panel and put the screws back in place. And you\u2019re done!\nIf you\u2019re worried about the iPhone\u2019s camera, flash or any performance related issues \u2013 the replacement of the back panel will not affect those in any way. I\u2019ve been using my iPhone with Tarxia installed for nearly a week now and have not noticed any changes whatsoever. The only thing that\u2019s changed is that I\u2019ve been getting some serious compliments!\n\nThe Tarxia I\u2019m reviewing here is the Kaleidoscope which is quite imaginative and gives off different patterns as you look at it.\nYou can see the entire collection here: http://www.tarxia.com/shop/ And you can find some making-of photos of Tarxia here: http://www.tarxia.com/lookbook/\nIf you\u2019ve upgraded to an iPhone 5, the Tarxia team is already working on a back cover for it, as well as a new range of designs.\nBuy it here\xa0\nIf an iPhone is not your thing, you might want to check out this big screen Motorola phone and its compatible mobile phone accessories.\n\n', 'title': u'Tarxia Taracea Wood iPhone Cover [Review]'}, {'image': u'http://www.holycool.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/TARDIS-Mold.jpg', 'link': u'http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-7303288-10746449?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thinkgeek.com%2Fproduct%2F13d7%2F%3Fref%3Dc&cjsku=13D7', 'description': u'\n  \nCreate yummy Tardis shaped goodies, may it be cake, gelatin, chocolate or anything you can come up with, using this set of Tardis silicone molds. $19.99 \nBuy it here\n', 'title': u'Doctor Who Tardis Silicone Mold'}, {'image': u'http://www.holycool.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Cityscape-Pen-Holder.jpg', 'link': u'http://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?qmde=src', 'description': u'\n  \nPen and stationery holder featuring iconic skyline of cities like New York, London and Paris. $5.41 \nBuy it here\n', 'title': u'Cityscape Pen Holder'}, {'image': u'http://www.holycool.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Currency-Coasters.jpg', 'link': u'http://shrsl.com/?~39tl', 'description': u'\n\n\nCoasters made of out-of-circulation U.S notes that are shredded and combined with polyester binder.

They therefore counsel us to get sad before life dashes our hopes at a moment of its own choosing. Reading these pessimists isn\u2019t actually a gloomy exercise.

The folks at Projecteo were kind enough to send us one for a review, so here it is!\n\nMuch like its title suggests, Projecteo is quite tiny. It is practically weightless and fits in the palm of your hand. For $34.98, you will get:\n\nThe Projecteo projector\nOne reel of photos (9 photos per reel).\nBatteries.\nFree worldwide shipping\n\nBy connecting to Instagram through Projecteo\u2019s site, you\u2019ll be able to view all your photos and add them to your reel. You can create and add additional reels to your order at $8.99 per reel.\nOperating your Projecteo couldn\u2019t be simpler, just insert the reel, turn the projector on and you\u2019re all set. To change from one photo to another, you\u2019ll manually rotate the wheel. At first, the projected image can be out of focus, so you\u2019ll have to rotate the lens on the projector to get the right focus.\n\nProjecteo works 100% as promised, the photos are well-printed into the reel (if that\u2019s the correct technical term) and display nicely on the wall. It was hard for me to take a photo of it in action, so in reality it is better than pictured above. The following video will give you a better idea for how it works:\n\nProjecteo is a great little toy that will give you a new fun way to share photos with family and friends.

The engraving is quite impressive, it\u2019s not just engraved lines on the case, it\u2019s very detailed with a 3D effect to it.\nThe case fits your iPhone snugly, it\u2019s the kind of case that you slide into your phone. It\u2019s constructed of two halves, the phone slides to the top half, then you slide in the bottom half. On the inside, the two halves have suede padding so you don\u2019t have to worry about scratching your iPhone.\nThe case does make your iPhone a little bulky. And while it looks very nice, I\u2019m not sure of how protective it is. I did have a little issue with it (it was totally my fault, though)\u2026 I had a small ring around the iPhone\u2019s camera for a magnetic lens, so when I slid in the top half of the case it cracked a little on the top. The good news it, the crack doesn\u2019t even show, and when I removed the ring, the case held together like new.\nOverall, I\u2019m quite happy with this case, I just \xa0love the camera look it gives my iPhone.\nHere\u2019s the sweet part: You can get $10 OFF your purchase if you decide to purchase something from SigniCASE.

Well, I personally believe it all depends on the design of the wallet itself, and not necessarily the \u2018wood\u2019 part of it.\n\n\nHaydanhuya\u2019s wallets are handmade from a solid piece of lime wood. They\u2019re made as limited edition pieces, and each wallet comes with a authenticity certification that includes the edition number of your wallet and your name. The edition of the wallet will be engraved on the back, too.\nThe wallet I received is the Woodwallet O . The material of it is pretty solid, and it\u2019s well-made. I was able to comfortably fit in three cards and a few folded bills in it. What I really like about this design in particular is the hole in the middle which makes it really easy to slide out your cards with a simple push with your thumb. And I was actually surprised that the cards and bills stayed securely in place even though it lacks the leather strip their original Wood wallet has.\n\nThis type of wallet isn\u2019t recommended for people who keep their wallets in their back pockets. Otherwise, it doesn\u2019t feel as bulky as you\u2019d imagine it to be. It makes a great cardholder to keep in your bag as well.\nWhat I\u2019d like to see is perhaps the ability to customize the wallets with a name, just to give it more of a personalization along with the edition number.\xa0 Overall, I\u2019m quite happy with the Haydanhuya wallet, and highly recommend it as a solid cardholder.\nPlease visit http://www.haydanhuya.com to see all their wallets, and you can see some \u2018making of\u2019 photos of the wallets here: http://haydanhuya.tumblr.com/\n\xa0\nWoodWallet O \u2013 $45 \nBuy it here\n', 'title': u'Haydanhuya Woodwallet O [Review]'}, {'image': u'http://www.holycool.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/iPooding-iPhone-Case3.jpeg', 'link': u'http://www.sumneeds.com/product_view.html?idx=32763', 'description': u'\n\n \nWhile the iPhone case market keeps filling up with tough and rigid cases, Korean design firm Sumneeds has created the softest iPhone case yet.
